# Game

This is my first attempt at making a game in go. It is designed to basically be some kind of boring adventure I suppose. Who really knows. I just wanted to learn a new language and decided to roll with it. Maybe it'll be some kind of platformer? For now there is nothing. Nothing I say!

Besides who even reads the readmes nowadays anyway.

Peace
